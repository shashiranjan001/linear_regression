## A self implemented Linear Regression with various loss functions and optimisations

1. The task is to predict house prices using different attributes like area in square feet, number of floors, number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms. 


2. Whole data is splitted into train(80%) and test(20%).
3. Different combnations of features like simple linear combinations, quadratic and cubic are tested.
4. Different loss functions like RMSE, Mean cubed error and Mean absolute error are tested.  
5. Iterative re-weighted least square method (http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/~srihari/CSE574/Chap4/4.3.3-IRLS.pdf) was also applied as the optimization method in one of the cases.
